# Week 5: Notes

- Basic Stats in R
  - This would have been so helpful to know on the 16th when my HCI assignment was due
  - Played with Romano-British Pottery dataset
    - Had no I idea what this data actually means but seems cool
    - Checked documentation --> examples on what they did with the dataset
      - Play with the different pottery compositions by plotting it
      - Pottery seems to be identifiable based on composition --> Welsh pottery seems to be <16% Al2O3 whereas pottery from New Forest is high in it
  - Oh woops got ahead of the tutorial
    - Pie chart clearer --> bargraph ascends beyond itself
    - Pithouse bar graph seems more sensible for it's purpose
    - Let's try Bronze Age italian cups this time
      - I plotted the height against rim diameter --> I wonder what this could tell me if I knew more about Bronze Age Italian cups
      - I feel that when comparing data, plots are the way to go --> visualization of like clusters, interesting outliers
      - It seems like the sub-apennine cups are generally more proprtional --> technological/tool advancement?
  - Stats Testing
    - Now I'm SO sad I didn't have this for my last HCI assignment
    - OxfordPots --> is there a correlation between the percentage of Oxford Pottery present and the availibity of water transportation?
      - Yes --> kind of a predictable result but predictable results help me understand the process more
  - Graveyards!
    - Oh boy the standardization is non-existent lol --> speaks to the system we used for classification?
    - First find correlation --> Condition of inscription vs date?
      - Inscription instead of monument bc inscriptions are harder to repair
        - Nope :(
      - Letter styles vs Date?
        - Yes? --> p-value WAY less than 0.05
    - PLOT TIME YAY
      - Okay if I want to graph this in anyway, I'd need to group the data, which I don't know how to do...
      - Will play with this more later


- Databases
  - Very excited by the fact that this is SQL/SQLite and not Excel
  - Will get to this next week --> not to worried about understanding bc COMP3005
  - Eager to try working with our graveyard data


- Kobotoolbox
  - I remember while going through the cemetary, and especially while cataloguing all of my graves, thinking "I know nothing about these people"
  - I can't think of how I would modify the form in terms of changing the categories --> categories used seem appropriate
  - Struggled with the code sheet itself translated to may feelings about the forms
    - Terminology --> I had no idea what some of the terms meant and searching came up with very little
      - Visual examples would be helpful --> tedious but a pdf with each term linked to an example with what's being described would have been amazing
    - Had no idea if the stone types used in the UK were also used or even available in Canada
    - No idea what exactly tooling is but seems to describe some sort of craft --> was this the same in Canada vs UK?
  - Had issue with restrictions kobotoolbox posed as the user of a form I didn't create
    - Could not got to a newline in textboxes --> could not preserve the form of the inscription on the grave
    - "Age" not a type category --> when recording the graves of babies, I had to put the age into notes because I couldn't use decimals or state that the "3" represented 3 months, not 3yrs


- Quotes
  - "It’s corporations like Facebook, and not individuals like Maria Munir, who have the power to control the terms of data collection."- D’Ignazio & Klein
    - We could have slapped anything in those kobotoolbox forms --> misrepresentation of history
  - "Historically, counting and classification have been used to dominate, discipline, and exclude."- D’Ignazio & Klein
  - "Artifact catalogs typically support a single form of identification (Figure 1, top), i.e. an artifact is either a brass point or a glass bead—it’s not both."- Labrador
    - Remember experiencing this at my internship --> didn't know what to do when something had more than one material because there was no "in-between"
  - "Destablilizing the empirical nature of archaeological databases will undo the assumptions we hold regarding the relationships between cause and effect in material culture and human behavior"- Labrador
  - "Yet, as Hutton has noted, the socialpower  of  an  archive  extends  beyond  legitimating  expert  authority  or  deter-miningwhatis  to  be  remembered  about  the  past—the  naturalization  ofarchives  has  actually  structuredhowmemory  is  formed." -Labrador
  - "If we continue to teach archaeological practice in the same way, framed by traditional field and laboratory structures, we cannot expect skills, attitudes, and approaches to change in favor of reuse."- Cook
  - "With a lack of resources written in plain language or designed for students/beginners, there was a significant investment in delivering this content in class and during office hours, not to mention developing course resources and workbooks, to explain the technology, interfaces, and terminology as well as their relevance to anthropology and how to make the most of them in research."- Cook
    - Oh my god don't even get me started on this
    - #1 pet peeve in all CS and related/applied fields
  - "Expectations of what anthropological research looks like in addition to attitudes regarding worth, research impact, and contributions were routinely in conflict with the values of open science, data reuse, sustainability, and ethics that were foundational in this course's design"- Cook
